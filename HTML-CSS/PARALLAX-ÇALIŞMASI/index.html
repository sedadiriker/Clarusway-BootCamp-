        <h3>Who is Full Stack Developer?</h3>
        <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets.</p>

    <div class="container-1">
        <span class="parallax2">Front end</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-2">
        <p>The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-2">
        <span class="parallax2">Back end</span>
    </div>

    <div class="text-2">
        <p>The backend is the server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine.</p>
